							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/coffee beans.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Here are the full synopsis and demos of my personal projects.</p>
							<h2>ShellTer</h2>
							<h3><u><a href="https://devpost.com/software/shellter">Submitted Hack at Technica 2022</a></u></h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Technica 2022 ShellTer Project (1).jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>What inspired us</h3>
							<p>Situations in which students were near areas where an incident occurred but they were not notified until hours later. The official police report being sent hours later than the incident doesn't secure the immediate safety of people in the area. People need to know as soon as possible when there is something dangerous going on near them so that they can avoid that path.</p>
							<h3>What ShellTer does</h3>
							<p>ShellTer is both an app and a website that allows a student or staff on campus to view reports of incidents in the area, report their own incident, or validate an incident that they witnessed. It serves as a platform for communicating and navigating to safety quickly and effectively.</p>
							<h3>How we built our project</h3>
							<p>Our project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript on repl.it for the website, as well as Thunkable for the app.</p>
							<h4>Here is a code snippet of the Google Maps API in HTML: </h4>
							<pre><code>
								//in script
								function myMap() {
								  var mapProp = {
									center: new google.maps.LatLng(38.9892649450202, -76.93705005918255),
									zoom: 17,
								  };
								  var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("googleMap"), mapProp);
								}
								//end script

								//in script
								src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyAb5exhyBG7redyEvDWZH4Zow2u6jTXDN4&callback=myMap">
								//end script

							</code></pre>
							<h4>And in script.js: </h4>
							<pre><code>
							function initMap() {
								const umd = { lat: 38.9869, lng: 76.9426 };
								const map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"), {
								  zoom: 2,
								  center: umd,
								});
								const marker = new google.maps.Marker({
								  position: umd,
								  map: map,
								});
							}
							  
							  window.initMap = initMap;
							  </code></pre>
							  <h4>Location tracking in script.js: </h4>
							  <pre><code>
								window.onload = () => {
								
									let h1 = document.getElementById("location"); 
									//allows us to change the location later
								
									navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
										let latitude = position.coords.latitude;    // This gets us the latitude
										let longitude = position.coords.longitude;  // This gets us the longitude  
									}
								}        
								</code></pre>
								<h4>Result:</h4>
								<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ShellTerDemo.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>
							<h3>What's next for ShellTer</h3>
							<p>In the future we plan to implement other features such as showing a brief description of the report if you hover over the marker. Also when someone reports, we will have an option for them to pick the level of emergency: low risk, medium, risk or high risk. Based on the risk level, their report will show up as a marker on the map for a respective amount of time. Low risk: 6 hours. Medium risk: 12 hours: High risk: 24 hours. We would want to develop a system to keep track of the data of the users reports so that they can be accessed by us and others. We also want to make it more user friendly and design the app and website better according to the theme. Additionally, we're thinking that it should be adaptable to other universities/colleges/schools/offices/etc.</p>

							<p>Our user-friendly app and website promote lasting, healthy relationships with nutrition and your body. Enjoy personalized vitamin and water gamified reminders, earning points for timeliness and consistency. Track your progress and unlock rewards like discounts at health-conscious stores and restaurants. Lemonaid is the ultimate platform for a healthier lifestyle!</p>
